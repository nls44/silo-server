// A Samples request reads the input through ffmpeg's concat demuxer: an
// ffconcat list, written to ffmpeg's stdin, names the input once per sample
// with an inpoint at the sample time and an outpoint just after it. The
// demuxer seeks to the keyframe at or before the inpoint, so with
// "-skip_frame:v nokey" only that keyframe is decoded, and only the sampled
// stretches of the file are read. Each entry tags its packets with a
// "sample" metadata entry holding the sample time, which the decoded frame
// carries into metadata=print; the frames' own timestamps follow the list,
// not the input.
//
// Inpoints are container timestamps, while sample times, like window starts,
// count from the start of the file, so each inpoint is the sample time plus
// the input's start time (see probe.go). Only containers whose index lets
// the demuxer seek to a keyframe are read this way; see runSamples for the
// others.
//
// The list is read from pipe:0, so relative entries would resolve against
// the pipe URL: each entry names the input as an explicit file: URL, and the
// input opens with a protocol whitelist of file and pipe (the concat demuxer
// otherwise allows neither).

// sampleSpanSeconds is how long after its inpoint each entry ends. It is
// short enough that a sample rarely decodes a second keyframe, and long enough
// that the demuxer never sees an empty entry.
