/**
 * Hover reveals are gated in CSS on `data-fine-pointer`, which
 * `lib/pointerCapability.ts` publishes from observed pointer events. These are
 * contract tests over app.css, the same shape as
 * `navigationTransitionCss.test.ts`.
 *
 * What matters: nothing here may fall back to a hover/pointer media feature.
 * Chromium on some Windows machines with a touchscreen reports
 * `any-hover: none` and `any-pointer: coarse` while a mouse is actively
 * hovering, so any rule left behind such a query is silently dead on exactly
 * the devices this gate exists to serve.
