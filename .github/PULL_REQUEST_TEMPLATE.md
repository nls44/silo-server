## Problem

Closes #NNN
<!-- One "Closes #NNN" line per issue this change fully resolves, so GitHub closes it
when the PR merges into main. Use "Closes Silo-Server/<repo>#NNN" for an issue in
another repository. Delete the line when the PR only partly addresses an issue. -->
Related issue: #NNN
<!-- An epic, sub-issue, or partly addressed issue this work serves and that should
stay open, or "N/A". An open issue is not required — the Problem section below must
stand on its own. -->
Validation tasks: #NNN C1
<!-- Until 1.0 ships: v1.0 board tasks and cases this change unblocks or changes
(see "1.0 validation" in AGENTS.md), e.g. "unblocks #1144 C3; changes #1200 C1".
Write "none" when no validation task is affected. -->

A short plain-language summary: what goes wrong, who it affects, and what this
change does about it. Details come after.

## Approach

What changed and why this way. Mention an alternative only if a reviewer would ask
about it. Do not walk through the diff.

## Validation

One line per kind of check and its result; do not list tests by name. Name required
checks that were not run or did not pass. Include a short output excerpt only when it
explains a failure.
<!-- Do not include private domains, hostnames, IPs, Tailscale or Report Shelf URLs,
local paths, credentials, personal data, or private media details. Attach screenshots
or recordings only when the user explicitly requests them. A maintainer may end this
section with `Evidence: https://evidence.siloserver.org/r/<repo>/<topic>/`; that page
requires Silo-Server organization sign-in. -->

## Risks

Migration, compatibility, security, or operational impact, or "None identified".
