# Jellyfin text subtitle delivery

Jellyfin playback negotiation accepts `DeviceProfile.SubtitleProfiles`. For text
tracks delivered separately from video, it prefers a matching external format
and otherwise uses an advertised external WebVTT format. This applies to embedded
text, external sidecars, and downloaded subtitles. Embedded tracks retain
`IsExternal: false`; `DeliveryMethod: "External"` describes delivery rather than
where the track is stored. Every embedded track keeps Embed delivery when the
profile supports it. Delivery method and format are negotiated for all available
text tracks, including when playback starts with subtitles off, so tracks enabled
or switched during playback use the same client-compatible URLs. Each embedded
or sidecar track's delivery settings are persisted with the playback source so
reconstruction produces the same delivery URL.

The authenticated subtitle route
`/Videos/{itemId}/{mediaSourceId}/Subtitles/{index}/stream.{format}` supports the
Jellyfin `.js` representation for text tracks. Its JSON object contains a
`TrackEvents` array. Each event contains `Id`, `Text`, `StartPositionTicks`, and
`EndPositionTicks`; one tick is 100 nanoseconds. Ordinary VTT, SRT, and ASS routes
retain their respective text representations. JSON delivery honors the same
start/end window and timestamp-copy options as text delivery. A window containing
no cues returns an empty `TrackEvents` array.

Complete embedded text extractions use the node-local subtitle cache. Cache
identity includes source path, modification time, size, track ordinal, and
output format. A source change during extraction prevents publication. Cache
failures do not prevent delivering a successful extraction, and incomplete
extracts are not published. A node's first request may still require a complete
file demux.

Repeated unstarted playback negotiations replace only negotiations with the same
source and track-selection variant. Distinct audio or subtitle selections keep
their own playback grants until they start or expire.

These are Jellyfin compatibility behaviors. Native Silo client API contracts are
unchanged.
